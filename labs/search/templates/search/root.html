            <p>

                We have some news regarding search functionality in JudaicaLink.

                As we said earlier, we plan to develop a full text search for JudaicaLink. Today, we launch a first
                version of it, although it is still very limited.

                You can now search our data, backed by ElasticSearch. We are currently mainly working again on the
                backend part of this, like the processes to populate the search index, the integration with the data
                pages and so on.
                <br><br>
                This first search functionality is therefore very limited: you can search in a subset of our data fields
                <b>(name/title, abstract, birthDate, deathDate, birthLocation, deathLocation)</b> and only the first 10 results are shown, as simple links to the data pages.

                Nevertheless we think this is already useful, as this way you can quickly find out,
                if there are some matching resources available in JudaicaLink, and you can also find quickly some new
                entries to explore our dataset.
                <br><br><b>
                So have fun with it - and be patient, it is still under heavy development and things inevitably will
                break.</b>
            </p>
